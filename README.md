# fx82MSESP8285Mod
## Modding a Casio fx-82MS calculator with an ESP8285 to make it controllable over WiFi.

***I'm not able to find a job over online applications. They said uploading some of the things I've created onto GitHub could help, so here we go with the first one.***

***I've originally created this mod to cheat on my exams during my collage years(back in 2011), but never actually used it to cheat. And first and foremostly I need to say that I don't condone cheating in education or academia, neither do I encourage anyone using this mod to cheat on their exams. This project is here simply for the sake of sharing and educational purposes.***
